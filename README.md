## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) or later
- JetBrains Rider, Visual Studio 2022+, or VS Code with C# Dev Kit

### Run from Rider

1. Open the `SecurityAwarenessBot` folder in JetBrains Rider
2. Select the `SecurityAwarenessBot` run configuration
3. Press **Run** (▶)

### Run from Terminal

```bash
cd SecurityAwarenessBot
dotnet run
```

### Build in Release mode

```bash
dotnet build SecurityAwarenessBot.csproj --configuration Release
```

| Keyword | Topic |
|---|---|
| `phishing` | Learn about phishing scams, red flags, and how to report them |
| `password` | Strong password guidance and recommended tools |
| `links` | Identifying suspicious URLs & what to do after clicking one |
| `tips` | General cybersecurity hygiene for South Africans |

## 🧱 Class Responsibilities

### `User.cs` — Model
Uses **automatic properties** to store:
- `Name` — entered during onboarding
- `SessionId` — auto-generated 8-char hex identifier
- `SessionStart` — `DateTime.Now` captured on construction
- `GetSessionDuration()` — derived elapsed time string

### `UserInterface.cs` — Presentation Layer
Centralises **all** console output:
- `SetColour()` / `WriteColoured()` — `Console.ForegroundColor` management
- `TypeWriteAsync()` — typewriter effect using `await Task.Delay(delayMs)`
- `DrawBorder()` / `DrawBox()` — unicode box-drawing characters
- `DisplayLogo()` — multi-colour ASCII art (Mankey Bot)
- `PrintHelpMenu()` / `PrintWarning()` / `PrintSuccess()` — status helpers

### `InputValidator.cs` — Validation
- `IsEmpty()` — guards against empty/whitespace input
- `IsExitCommand()` / `IsHelpCommand()` — keyword detection
- `Sanitise()` — trim, lowercase, collapse whitespace
- `GetFallbackMessage()` — helpful fallback for unknown commands

### `ChatEngine.cs` — Business Logic
- `ClassifyInput()` — maps sanitised input → `Topic` enum via `ContainsAny()`
- `GetResponseAsync()` — orchestrates routing, quiz state, control codes
- Quiz state machine: `QuizState` enum, 5-question sequential flow

### `AudioPlayer.cs` — Audio
- Windows runtime guard via `RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform()`
- `EnsureWavFileExists()` — programmatic WAV generator (no external assets needed)
- Wrapped in `try/catch` — audio failures never crash the bot

## 🔄 CI/CD — GitHub Actions

The workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` triggers on every `push` and `pull_request`:

1. **Checkout** repository
2. **Setup .NET 6** via `actions/setup-dotnet@v3`
3. **Restore** packages
4. **Build** in Release mode
5. **Publish** to confirm no missing assets

---

## 🔐 Privacy Statement

Monkey Bot does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal information. All data (your name and session details) exists only in memory for the duration of the session and is discarded on exit.
